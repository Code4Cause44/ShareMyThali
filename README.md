üí° About the Project
In a world where food waste is rampant and hunger persists, ShareMyThali aims to be a digital bridge. Our mission is to create a low-waste food-sharing ecosystem where excess food from homes and businesses can be easily donated, and verified NGOs can efficiently request and receive it. We prioritize food safety, transparency, and a smooth user experience to maximize impact.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend (Node.js/Express):

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

bcryptjs: For hashing and salting passwords securely.

jsonwebtoken (JWT): For creating and verifying authentication tokens.

dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Frontend (React):

React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing in React applications.

Context API: For global state management (authentication).

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn.

Download Node.js

MongoDB:

Install MongoDB Community Server

Alternatively, use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ShareMyThali

Install Backend Dependencies:

cd backend
npm install
# or yarn install

Install Frontend Dependencies:

cd ../frontend # Navigate back to root, then into frontend
npm install
# or yarn install

Environment Variables
You need to create .env files for both your backend and frontend.

Backend .env file:

Create a file named .env in the backend directory.

Add the following variables:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sharemythali # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE # Generate a long, random string

To generate a JWT_SECRET: Open your Node.js terminal and run require('crypto').randomBytes(60).toString('hex'). Copy the output and use it as your secret.

Frontend .env file (Optional, if you have specific frontend env vars):

Create a file named .env in the frontend directory.

(Currently, the frontend directly uses http://localhost:5000 for API calls, so no specific REACT_APP_API_URL is needed unless you plan to deploy).

Running the Application
Start the MongoDB Server:

If running locally, ensure your MongoDB daemon (mongod) is running.

If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your cluster is accessible.

Start the Backend Server:

Open a new terminal.

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Start the server:

npm start
# or node server.js

You should see MongoDB connected and Server running on port 5000 in the console.

Start the Frontend Development Server:

Open another new terminal.

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Start the React app:

npm start
# or yarn start

This will typically open your application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

üìù Usage
Register:

Navigate to /register.

Choose your role: "Food Donor" or "Receiving Organization".

Fill in the required details and register.

Login:

Navigate to /login.

Enter your registered email and password to log in.

Donate Food (Donors):

After logging in as a "Donor", navigate to /donate.

Fill out the donation form with details about your surplus food.

Request Food (Organizations):

After logging in as an "Organization", navigate to /request.

Browse available food donations and submit requests for the quantity you need.

My Donations (Donors):

Navigate to /my-donations to view and manage your submitted donations.

My Requests (Organizations):

Navigate to /my-requests to view the status of your organization's food requests.

üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements
This project is continuously evolving. Here are some key features planned for future development to make it even more robust and hackathon-winning worthy:

Donor/Organization Dashboards: Enhanced dashboards with detailed views, filtering, and actions (e.g., donors accepting/rejecting requests, organizations cancelling requests).

Real-time Notifications: Implement WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) to notify donors of new requests and organizations of request status changes.

Location-Based Matching: Allow organizations to filter donations by proximity to their location.

User Profile Management: Enable users to update their personal/organization details.

Review and Rating System: Allow users to rate each other to build trust and accountability.

Admin Panel: A dedicated interface for administrators to manage users, donations, and requests across the platform.

Automated Reminders: Implement scheduled tasks for pickup reminders or donation expiration.

Deployment: Deploy the full-stack application to cloud platforms (e.g., Render, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas).

Advanced UI/UX: Further polish the user interface with animations, improved feedback, and accessibility features.
