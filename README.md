## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) & **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**.
    * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **MongoDB:**
    * [Install MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ShareMyThali
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Navigate back to root, then into frontend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

You need to create `.env` files for both your backend and frontend.

  **Backend `.env` file:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory.
    * Add the following variables:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sharemythali # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
        PORT=5000
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE # Generate a long, random string
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the MongoDB Server:**
    * If running locally, ensure your MongoDB daemon (`mongod`) is running.
    * If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your cluster is accessible.

2.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * Open a new terminal.
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Start the server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or node server.js
        ```
    * You should see `MongoDB connected` and `Server running on port 5000` in the console.

3.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    * Open another new terminal.
    * Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    * Start the React app:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or yarn start
        ```
    * This will typically open your application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
